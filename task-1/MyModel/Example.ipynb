Hated things where I had to memorize. Kids were usually mean to me in elementary/middle school. By highschool I took more courses that were math-y and didn\\'t need to much... I am introvert and I am offence !!!! link close this thread already omg You\\'d be surprised. Going through your other posts, I gathered you were treated like shit and betrayed by the people you were supposed to trust. I\\'ve been too and have developed mental disorders... Clearly all those things people say are said because they don\\'t understand that not everybody thinks like them. They don\\'t understand what depression does to a person. Hell, I don\\'t even understand... I originally typed as INTJ and it took a lot of reading and internal debates to get INFJ of the two. I\\'d get frustrated but not at them. I\\'ll continue to help them because I understand how it\\'s... link And yes I have. My most recent was 5w6, 9w8, 3w2 The functions I see in you are fe, si, ti, and ne. So I understand why you typed as an isfj. But I don\\'t agree with the stack since you don\\'t seem to be aux fe. Maybe you\\'re ti > ne > si > fe? INTP?... Unsure on my brother and sister but I\\'m pretty sure my dad\\'s istp and mom isfj. Will confirm when they finally give into taking the test :p I shut my mouth and don\\'t argue with them. Keep the peace :laughing: Actually I\\'ve been developing Fe a lot lately. I used to be really indifferent to others and in my own head more. A day dreamer more than anything. So much that my elementary school teachers thought... I get where you\\'re coming from when you say I use si but all the cognitive tests say my si is very low. And isfj say that laws are there because they work. I don\\'t believe that. Others believe that...@user HELP GAHAHAHAHAHAVSHS @user gmm ari! @user hi ray! @user gmm, yui! @user HELP??  @user__ bleu  @user gmm, tsuko! @user i was thinking i\\'d use this to greet you three kanina  @user tob, kisses, m&amp;m, snickers  yes i\\'m still awake, vote maybe? link @user WELCOMEEE BACKK ARI!!

Just called her, it was pretty quick but she seemed pleasantly surprised, and it went pretty neatly. I had doubts lately, mainly due to the fact that I can\\'t talk to her as easily and as... Pff, Dolfie was totally ESFJ. he was good at manipulating people and telling them what their role in society was (Fe), and he had much respect for traditions (Si). Just kidding. See how easy it is... I used your avatar for a silly song. link Caution: all clichés in this song are used ironically. Anyway, welcome back! What if the MBTI isn\\'t based on any objective data? Heh. Well, anyway, it appears eye tracking can be pretty helpful, and Bill Gates seemed to have Ni according to it cause his eyes were going in... You know, sometimes it seems MBTI is kind of bogus, too. There is a correlation between S and J / N and P. According to the various functions test on the web, most people don\\'t actually have their... Who\\'s to say your typings are more accurate than his? I\\'d have thought he\\'s INTJ. Really? Can you explain? What I meant is that she doesn\\'t have a cellphone. Plus, she hates being on the computer and facebook/skype/whatever. Well, uh, the date was Saturday, and I had told her she should come eat with me and my few friends, which I reminded her on our only class together, and which she did. Not sure if that was a good... I mean the typical INFJ walls around her true personality. Like, she sounds like she thinks through what she says way too much... She doesn\\'t talk much about herself and keeps pretty distant, but I...\\'I used to be incredibly imaginative, but it seems adulthood has smothered that part of me. Yep. All the time. Nope. Things that irritate me: loud music, electronic music, crowds, drinking/smoking/drugs, being around people doing these things When I\\'m feeling particularly social, I have a few buddies... Pretty much this. Everyone meaningful to me is highly intelligent even if I don\\'t directly seek it in people. A roommate of mine got me a job working for a company his mother owns, and I was introduced as Ecky. I worked there for about 6 months and everyone called me Ecky. I would be uncomfortable, I... I haven\\'t, but I have been called a few different things and have answered and identified with them. This reminds me of a thought experiment I used to go through with people on the idea of... I\\'m not so sure about that. Although most of what he says seems only to intersect our reality at a point, the point at which it does is generally too relevant and interesting for me to accept that... I\\'m in. Sometimes I\\'ll put myself at the center of attention if necessary, but never because I enjoy it. Fantasy-based infatuation is something I was often victim to a few years ago, but have more recently gained some perspective on and have actually come to appreciate.
